The demo\ninitializes impress.js like this:\n \n<script src=\"js/impress.js\"></script>\n<script>impress().init();</script>\n \nYou want to change this to the following:\n \n<script src=\"js/impress.js\"></script>\n<script>\nvar api = impress();\napi.init();\n</script>\n \nThe key difference here is that you now have a JavaScript variable called api that you can call\nimpress's methods on. The full documentation is in impress's index.html, but in short, you now have\napi.next(), api.prev(), and api.goto() for moving around the slideshow.\n \nFor timing the transitions between slides, you can use two functions that are part of JavaScript\nitself; no need for jQuery or anything. These functions are setInterval() and setTimeout(). They both\ntake two arguments: a thing to call, and a delay (in milliseconds) to wait before calling it.\nsetInterval() will call your thing over and over again; setTimeout() will call it once.\n \n \nFor instance, if you make the changes above, the simplest thing you can add is an auto-advancing\ninterval, like so:\n \nsetInterval(api.next, 5000);\n \nThat will move to the next slide every 3 seconds.\n\nfrom the impress.js source code\n\n `api.init()` - initializes the presentation,\n`api.next()` - moves to next step of the presentation,\n`api.prev()` - moves to previous step of the presentation,\n`api.goto( idx | id | element, [duration] )` - moves the presentation to the step given by its index number\nid or the DOM element; second parameter can be used to define duration of the transition in ms,\nbut it's optional - if not provided default transition duration for the presentation will be used.\n\n*/\n"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1708}]],"length":1708}
